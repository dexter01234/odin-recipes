        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>I made this up one day when I couldn't find a recipe anywhere with 
            these ingredients. So i kind of threw it together on a whim. Sugar can
            be adjusted for sweetness, and if the sauce gets a bit thicker than 
            desired i suggest adding a little chicken broth as it.s thickening. 
            Serve immediately over rice.
